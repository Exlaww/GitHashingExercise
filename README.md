Task: 
Generate a unique 4-digit integer, i.e. by using the last four digits of your student ID (AEM). Create a script in a shell of your choice named hash_script, where it should take a 4-digit integer as input and output a hash of the input. You can use any standard hashing algorithm (like SHA-256), run the script with your unique 4-digit integer and save the output in a file named hash_output.txt
Use Git commands to add and commit hash_script and hash_output.txt to your local repository. Lastly, create a new public repository named GitHashingExercise on github.com and push your local commits to the remote repository.

In this case:
AEM: 10078
Repository: https://github.com/Exlaww/GitHashingExercise
